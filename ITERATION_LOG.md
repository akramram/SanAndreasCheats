  - `.cj-attention` class: applies the attention animation with enhanced amber glow
  - `cj-celebrate` keyframe: multi-bounce jump (1.2s) with scale pulses and green glow transition — bounces up to 30px, scales to 1.2x, shifts glow from amber to green
  - `.cj-celebrate` class: one-shot celebration animation
  - `speech-pop` keyframe: bubble pops in from below with overshoot bounce
  - `speech-fade` keyframe: bubble fades upward and shrinks
  - `.cj-speech-bubble`: pixel-art styled speech bubble with Press Start 2P font, amber border, dark background, triangular pointer (CSS triangles via ::before and ::after)
  - `.cj-speech-bubble.fade-out`: triggers the fade animation

  - `clampAndSet()`: sets `cjMood` to 'typing' on any input
  - Cheat match block: sets `cjMood` to 'celebrating', picks random phrase from ['YEAH!', 'AWW YEAH!', 'GROVE ST!', 'NICE ONE!', 'HELL YEAH!', 'SWEET!', 'OOH YEAH!'], triggers speech bubble fade at 1.5s, clears at 2s, returns CJ to 'typing' at 1.2s
  - `resetOnInactivity()`: resets `cjMood` to 'idle', clears speech state
  - CJ avatar JSX: dynamic class switching between `cj-bob` (idle), `cj-attention` (typing), `cj-celebrate` (matched)
  - Speech bubble element: renders above CJ when `cjSpeech` is set, with `fade-out` class for exit

### What Improved
- CJ now has 3 reactive states: idle bobbing → attentive rocking when typing → celebration bounce on cheat match
- Speech bubble with GTA-themed phrases ("GROVE ST!", "HELL YEAH!") pops in on match
- Green glow on CJ during celebration matches the cheat match color scheme
- Smooth state transitions: idle → typing (immediate), celebrating → typing (after 1.2s), typing → idle (on inactivity reset)
- Speech bubble has pixel-art styling with pointed triangle, matching the overall aesthetic

### Issues
- None. Build and lint pass cleanly.
- All existing game logic (input handling, cheat matching, gamepad API) untouched.

### Next Iteration

  - `resetOnInactivity()`: Detects fails (had input, no match, timed out) — triggers fail overlay, CJ disappointment, streak reset
  - `clampAndSet()`: Sets `hadInputSinceMatch` on input
  - Cheat match block: Increments streak, updates best streak/time in localStorage, triggers combo animation, escalates fireworks with combo multiplier
  - `triggerFireworks(comboMultiplier)`: Particle count scales 40→80, spread distance increases 15% per combo level, confetti count scales 30→70
  - Combo-tiered speech phrases: solo (YEAH!), double (DOUBLE!), triple+ (HOT STREAK!), 5+ (UNSTOPPABLE!)

## Iteration 7 — Police Spotlight & Typing Match Progress Indicator
**Date:** 2026-04-18
**Branch:** visual-iterations
**GitHub Issue:** #9 — [🎨 Visual Iteration 7: Police Spotlight & Typing Match Progress Indicator](https://github.com/akramram/SanAndreasCheats/issues/9)

### Planned
- Police helicopter spotlight effect sweeping across the cityscape
- Typing match progress indicator — real-time visual feedback on partial cheat matches
- Ground reflection when spotlight passes

### What Changed (Files Modified)
- **src/App.css** — Added:
  - `spotlight-sweep` keyframe: sweeping left-to-right with opacity variation and skewX(-25deg) for angled cone shape, 14s cycle

  - `.police-spotlight-2`: secondary smaller spotlight — 35vw wide, 240px tall, slightly dimmer, different timing (18s cycle, no delay) for visual variety and depth
  - `ground-glow-sweep` keyframe and `.spotlight-ground-glow`: radial gradient at the base of the spotlight that follows the sweep, creating a ground reflection effect
  - `.char-matched`: green color (#4ade80) with green glow text-shadow for correctly typed characters
  - `.char-miss`: red color (#f87171) with red glow and reduced opacity for wrong characters
  - `.char-neutral`: amber color for unmatched characters
  - `.match-progress-bar`: thin 2px gradient bar (green-to-amber) under the input box showing best match ratio via CSS `--progress` variable with smooth transition
- **src/pages/Home.jsx** — Added/updated:
  - `inputCharStates` useMemo: Computes per-character match state by checking current input buffer against all cheat prefixes (both PC and PS sequences). Characters matching a cheat prefix get 'matched', last character gets 'miss' if nothing matches, rest are 'neutral'. Purely visual — no effect on game logic.
  - `matchProgress` useMemo: Computes best match ratio (matched chars / total cheat length) across all cheats for the progress bar
  - Spotlight JSX elements: `.police-spotlight`, `.police-spotlight-2`, `.spotlight-ground-glow` rendered as background layers between fog and dust particles
  - Input character rendering: each `<span>` now receives dynamic class based on `inputCharStates[i]` ('char-matched', 'char-miss', or empty for neutral)
  - Match progress bar JSX: renders below input text when `matchProgress > 0`, showing a green-to-amber gradient bar that fills proportionally

### What Improved
- Cityscape now has dynamic police helicopter searchlights sweeping across the scene, adding life and atmosphere — very GTA SA
- Two spotlights at different speeds/heights create a parallax depth effect
- Subtle ground reflection follows the spotlight, grounding the effect
- Typing now gives real-time visual feedback: matching characters turn green with glow, wrong characters turn red — helps players know they're on the right track
- Thin progress bar under input shows how close you are to completing any cheat code
- No game logic was touched — matching, input handling, and gamepad API are completely untouched

### Issues
- Lint: 2 pre-existing warnings (no new warnings introduced)
- All game logic (input handling, cheat matching, gamepad API) untouched

### Next Iteration
- **Iteration 8:** Enhanced history modal with retro game stats, mini leaderboard, and visual flair
- **Iteration 9:** More dynamic atmospheric effects — pulsing neon signs on buildings, car headlight trails

---

## Iteration 6 — CRT Boot Screen & Smooth State Transitions
**Date:** 2026-04-17
**Branch:** visual-iterations
**GitHub Issue:** #8 — [🎨 Visual Iteration 6: CRT Boot Screen & Smooth State Transitions](https://github.com/akramram/SanAndreasCheats/issues/8)

### Planned
- Add a retro CRT boot/start screen that plays on page load (GTA SA style — green terminal text, scanlines intensify, then "boot" into main UI)
- Smooth CSS transitions between UI states (idle → typing → matched → idle) with opacity, transform, and filter changes
- Input border transitions from dim to glowing amber when typing starts
- Match display gets a smoother entrance/exit transition
- HUD bar slides in after boot sequence completes

  - `.boot-prefix`, `.boot-value`, `.boot-ok`, `.boot-warn`: color-coded terminal text
  - `.boot-ready`: "PRESS ANY KEY TO START" prompt with blinking cursor bar
  - `.boot-cursor-bar`: pixel blinking cursor
  - `.boot-power-line`: horizontal CRT power-on line effect
  - `.boot-noise`: SVG noise texture for authentic CRT static
  - `main-ui-reveal` keyframe: fade-in with brightness transition after boot
  - `.main-ui-booted`: class applied to main UI after boot completes

- **src/pages/Home.jsx** — Added/updated:
  - `BOOT_LINES` constant: array of 8 terminal-style boot messages (cheat database, gamepad API, keyboard input, CJ avatar, cityscape, scanlines, Grove Street)
  - `BootScreen` component: stateful boot sequence with 5 phases (power-on → logo → subtitle → lines → ready → zoom-out), auto-advances through timed phases, renders green terminal text with staggered line reveals, CRT flicker animation, power-on line, and noise overlay
  - `booted` state: tracks whether boot sequence has completed
  - Main container: conditionally renders `BootScreen` when not booted, hides main UI content during boot (opacity: 0), adds `main-ui-booted` class after boot
  - HUD bar: adds `hud-enter` class after boot for slide-in animation
  - Input border: adds `input-glow-active` class for smooth border glow transition
  - Prompt text: adds `prompt-enter` class for smooth entrance after boot

### What Improved
- First-time users now see a dramatic CRT boot sequence that sets the retro gaming tone immediately
- Boot screen features: CRT power-on flicker, horizontal scan line, SVG noise static, green terminal text with staggered line reveals, "SA CHEATS" glowing logo, "GRAND THEFT AUTO: SAN ANDREAS" subtitle, and "PRESS ANY KEY TO START" with blinking cursor
- Boot-to-main transition is cinematic: screen zooms out with brightness flash, then main UI fades in smoothly
- HUD bar now slides in from the top with a bounce easing after boot completes
- Input border smoothly transitions to a brighter amber glow when typing (not just text glow — the whole border lights up)
- Prompt text has a smooth entrance animation instead of just appearing
- Overall first impression is dramatically better — the boot screen sells the retro GTA SA aesthetic before gameplay even starts

### Issues
- Lint: 2 pre-existing warnings (no new warnings introduced)
- All game logic (input handling, cheat matching, gamepad API) untouched
- Boot sequence takes ~3.6 seconds total (configurable via timer constants)

### Next Iteration
- **Iteration 7:** Enhanced history modal with retro game stats, mini leaderboard, and visual flair
- **Iteration 8:** Animated background improvements — more dynamic starfield, occasional police helicopter spotlight effect

**Branch:** visual-iterations
**GitHub Issue:** #10 — [🎨 Visual Iteration 8: Neon Signs & Car Headlight Trails](https://github.com/akramram/SanAndreasCheats/issues/10)

### Planned
- Add pulsing neon sign lights on the cityscape buildings (GTA SA-style neon signs in various colors — pink, blue, green, amber, red)
- Add animated car headlight trails at the bottom of the scene (horizontal streaks of light traveling left/right, like traffic in Los Santos at night)
- Neon signs flicker and glow with varied timing
- Headlight trails are subtle but add motion to the cityscape

### What Changed (Files Modified)
- **src/App.css** — Added:
  - 5 `neon-pulse-*` keyframes (pink, blue, green, amber, red) — smooth glow box-shadow pulsing at varied intensities
  - `neon-flicker` keyframe — occasional rapid blink for authentic flickering neon sign effect
  - `.neon-sign` — fixed position container with configurable color, size, and animation via CSS variables
  - `.neon-sign-inner` — the visible neon bar with pixelated rendering
  - `.neon-sign.flicker` — dual animation combining pulse + flicker for unreliable neon effect
  - `headlight-travel-right` and `headlight-travel-left` keyframes — horizontal movement with fade-in/out at edges
  - `.car-headlight` — fixed position element traveling across screen at configurable speed, height, and delay
  - `.car-headlight-beam` — the visible light trail with gradient from transparent to bright white
  - `.car-headlight-dot` — bright point at the leading edge of the headlight with glow box-shadow
  - `.car-headlight.going-right/left` — directional dot positioning (leading edge on right for rightward travel, etc.)
  - `.car-taillight-beam` — dimmer red trail for oncoming/away traffic
  - `.car-taillight-dot` — small red dot with glow
- **src/pages/Home.jsx** — Added:
  - 10 neon sign elements placed along the building line at various heights (128-162px from bottom):
    - 2 pink signs (flickering) on left building cluster
    - 2 blue signs (steady) on mid building
    - 1 green sign (flickering) on right cluster
    - 1 amber sign (steady) on far right
    - 1 red sign (flickering) on far right (like a bar's "OPEN" sign)
    - 2 more signs in second row on taller buildings (pink steady, blue flickering)
    - 1 amber sign high up on a tall building
  - 7 car headlight/taillight elements at street level (22-48px from bottom):
    - 5 white/warm headlight trails with varied speeds (5-15s), directions, and lengths (45-80px)
    - 2 red taillight trails for opposite-direction traffic

### What Improved
- Cityscape now has authentic neon signs pulsing on building facades in 5 colors — very GTA SA Las Venturas / Los Santos vibe
- 4 of 10 signs have a flickering effect that occasionally blinks rapidly, mimicking old broken neon signage
- Neon signs are placed at varied heights on the buildings, creating a layered vertical distribution
- Car headlight and taillight trails stream across the bottom of the scene at different speeds and heights, simulating nighttime traffic on a city street
- Different trail lengths and brightness levels create depth — faster cars have longer trails, slower ones shorter
- Red taillight trails add realism to the traffic flow
- All animations are GPU-accelerated (transform + opacity only) for smooth 60fps performance

### Issues
- Lint: 2 pre-existing warnings (no new warnings introduced)
- All game logic (input handling, cheat matching, gamepad API) untouched

### Next Iteration
- **Iteration 9:** Enhanced history modal with retro game stats, mini leaderboard, and visual flair
- **Iteration 10:** More atmospheric effects — occasional plane with blinking lights flying across sky
